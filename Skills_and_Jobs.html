										<h2>Position 1: Lesson planner  -Kaylyn & Alisa</h2>
									</header>
									<p>One of the positions would need to be the Lesson Planner. This position’s role is to design lessons across different subjects that would appeal to children. They work similarly to a teacher, however cater to a more virtual demographic to have functioning classes within this project. In order to do this, the skills and qualifications of the Lesson Planner would have to have a degree in early learning education, as well as a moderate understanding of childhood development, which ensures that the difficulty of lessons will be accurate according to the target audience’s ages (8-12). They will also need to have the skill to communicate with a team in order to make the lesson plans come to life, as they will have minimal knowledge in the development of the actual VR class. The Lesson Planner should also be creative in order to engage the children based on the preposition of this project in creating an immersive and appealing education.</p>
									<p>These lessons should be innovative and unique in order to make VR classes interactive and fun for children. The Lesson planner has to subsection all the varieties of lessons that are going to be taught to the children. Within that they are to formulate a daily/weekly lesson plan in a semester of what is going to be taught and materials needed to make the class possible. They then need to initially communicate with the rest of the team to come up with concept designs for the rest of the classes and possibly what needs to be included in the world based on their educational perspective in knowing what the children may need/prefer. This communication and vision will only need to be processed in the beginning as the objects can later be recycled for future use and lessons. However as time goes on and the Lesson planner may see the need for improvements they will communicate again with the rest of the team to cater better to the needs of this project's demographic.</p>

										<h2>Position 2: World designer  - Eric & Alisa</h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>One position would be the World Designer, who would need to specialise in designing spaces and environments that appeal to young children and team skills. The world designer needs to be able to process the visions of the team and be thinking innovatively/creatively to be able to formulate rough sketches and then process them into the final concept sketches, preferably both physical and virtual. They also need to have experience in designing for 3d spaces/concepts or even physical buildings (as it can be applicable). Therefore their skills must be artistic in drawing and designing as well as the ability to communicate well with the project team to come up with a viable design. The specific skills needed are the ability to use autodesk programs for professional sketchups, when creating the sketches they also need to be mindful of the limitations within the VR world (what can and can’t be done). This means that communication and teamwork capability is important in order for the visuals to satisfy everyone's wants. 
									</p>
									<p>Their task would be the design of the world the children and teacher would interact with, designing an appealing and interactive classroom by working with the Lesson Planner, which they will work together with the World Developer to manifest. They will come up with initial sketches that line up to the visions of the lesson planner, following approval they will create finalized concepts of the VR classroom and the objects needed for each lesson plan. They will mainly be all virtual sketchups for easy legibility and accessibility for the object modeler. After the designs have been created and approved by the team they will be sent to the object modeler for the 3d creation.</p>

										<h2>Position 3: Object Modeler - Alisa</h2>
									</header>
									<p>To take this project into the next phases, a person we would employ would be an object modeler. They are involved in creating original computerized 3D objects/models and environments that are needed for (in this case) the virtual world, as well as the classroom itself. The skills and qualifications needed would be graphic design, the ability to utilize modeling programs such as blender, unity, 3ds max etc in a professionally skilled manner and proficiency in programming languages that may be needed for functioning models or areas of the class. They need to ensure they have a good eye for detail and be able to visualize the outcome based on sketches. The interpersonal skills mainly needed would be teamwork and communication to understand the direction and 3d needs of this project with critical feedback and working alongside a team.</p>
									<p>In this project they will be incharge of creating the VR classroom world in unity and blender, creating the structure out of the proposed architectural concept and furnishing it with the individual 3d components they have made for this project. They will also be creating 3d models based on the visions of the project and design concepts from the world designer, within blender, such as locker, carpets, beanbags etc. Whilst for each different lesson they’ll be making models based on the subject such as in maths, making abacuses and functional calculators etc. They will then forward the models and classroom to the world developer who will further combine and develop the project.</p>

										<h2>Position 4: World Developer - Eric & Alisa</h2>
									</header>
									<p>One position would be the Unity world Developer, they need experience in creating 3D game environments, think of ways to manipulate VRchats Software Development Kit to create solutions and team skills. After all the components from the team they will then take all considerations and creations to develop them into the project's final prospect. The developer needs to have experience in gaming software such as mentioned earlier and be able to knowledgeably maneuver in them to prevent errors and setbacks. The developer may need skills in programming languages if the functions within unity require more complex and unprecedented actions as this is a newer form of providing education. As the rest of the team they need to have great communication skills to be able to develop the project into a functional educational classroom that is suitable for other children to learn in. Being the developer they also need to provide the team with frequent updates to ensure everything is coming along smoothly, and take on a leadership role if other teams' visions may be impractical when developing the project itself. 
									</p>
									<p>They would need to work closely with the World Designer by using finalized sketches and to a lesser degree the Lesson Planner to create the actual world the children and teacher will interact with so it lines up with what will be happening when teaching, by creating it to the specifications of the World Designer and applying it to Unity and VRchats Software Development Kit. Utilizing the designers' 3d models and creating a school environment, they are to curate the classroom into a learnable environment by being able to convert and import objects into unity and make sure everything is developed to be compatible when used in practice. They also need to create functions within the world for interactive purposes when others are operating with the models and configure objects to suit the VR world.</p>
