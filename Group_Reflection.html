									<p>The group did overall very well in the communication and labour division department. Everyone understood what was expected of them and completed them despite interruptions and circumstances. While I believe we did a good job as a whole, I feel like I did not contribute as well as others on the team. Other subjects greatly split my attention and I was not able to complete my tasks at a satisfactory level. What surprised me though was the understanding on the part of my group. Adjusting around not only mine but also the circumstances of other members. Allowing us to adjust our tasks to be manageable and thus still contribute to the group.

									<p>Like always, communication between group members is our biggest strength, as a matter of fact, it was better than the last assignment. There were some members who were not able to complete specific tasks or struggled with certain aspects, such as using Blender, but as a result of our communication and transparency, we were able to make arrangements to compromise with their situations, such as hosting help-sessions and rearranging work-loads.
									</p>
									<p>I strongly believe that one thing that could be improved would be to have more group members involved in the practical part of the project. Although creating in Blender has a large learning curve and requires a lot of persistence to use, I believe that we could have worked on even larger scale objects as opposed to simply creating organs. I also would have liked some members to be more involved with the game development and Unity process.</p>
									<p>There isn't much more that I learnt about groups that I haven't already learnt from my last assignment, although I can say that I have experienced the importance of transparency between team members and the positive impacts it can bring. Although due to my shyness and tendency to overload myself with work, it becomes difficult to express my exhaustion without feeling an overwhelming amount of shame and embarrassment. Despite this, i hope to overcome those feelings; and to put it simply- cut myself some slack.</p>

									<p>The group maintained good communication throughout the assignment and everyone understood their roles and tasks. Everyone completed their tasks well despite interruptions and circumstances that occurred. Although we did work quicker since the last assignment, we definitely could’ve worked even quicker. One thing that was surprising was that despite absences caused by sudden interruptions and circumstances, people took initiative in order to catch others or themselves up. Something valuable that I learned from this group is that everyone was always willing to help, and although tasks and roles are delegated, it doesn’t mean you can’t ask others for help.

									<p>Like last time, this group did very well communicating and accounting for ourselves with absences by having good initiative and other members providing great updates for others. The hard work done by others has been able to positively contribute to the creation and functionality of this difficult project. An improvement from last time is our time management as we worked slightly faster to reach small deadlines before the next class and were less stressed. However it could still be improved upon by doing more work in the earlier stages, so we still need to work on some time management. I also feel like I didn’t contribute enough, so maybe I need to improve by doing more work or taking on more. A thing I learned in this group is the amazing abilities that others can offer and how much of a quick learner everyone is when it comes to creating components for this project. I initially was worried about how difficult this may be to develop due to our limited experience but everyone amazingly pulled through. Another thing I learnt was how flexible the team was in modifying how they contribute to the project to better suit theirs and others abilities, as well as how willing everyone was to help each other when we weren’t sure of what to do.

									<p>Our group is a group with an excellent atmosphere. Each member is willing to communicate and work hard to complete part of the project, ensuring that when his part can be completed, he will try his best to help others. Everyone always keeps enthusiasm when doing projects. Because our projects need to learn new technologies, learning new technologies requires us to watch a lot of tutorial videos. Every member has spent a lot of time learning this technology and Discuss ways to make the model look more realistic on discord. Everyone still maintains this great enthusiasm to learn blender without a foundation, which is exciting. As the developer of our website, I often urge my teammates to complete the parts they need to complete. Although some parts will be delayed for a short while, teammates try their best to complete the parts that need to be completed within the specified time. Every time I urge my teammates, I get a positive response. The entire team has excellent chemistry and has been able to maintain efficient communication, which helped me a lot when designing the website.

									<p>Throughout the whole assignment, the group had great chemistry since we were able to communicate easily and efficiently as we were providing great feedback and giving updates. The group directive was also quite easy as we all knew what each wanted to do as well as the fact that we were all open to each other and what we all brought to the table so we could decide upon what each of our respective roles were. We were also able to make up for each other’s flaws and therefore made up a good team and did things to the best of our ability since we didn’t want to let any of our team fail. I also found that people were taking the initiative this time round to ask if they missed any classes or meetings as well as joining meetings in difficult positions such as being on the train or on the bus, they still joined and communicated using the chat which helped us.

										<h2>Group Reflection (Eric Lin) </h2>
									</header>
									<p>Overall, it was clear that our group had fantastic chemistry, able to communicate both clearly and efficiently. We seemed to just click in a way and become quick acquaintances and friends. Everyone clearly understood their roles and tasks and were able to complete them to a great degree of satisfaction. While many of us suffered interruptions, delays and other detrimental circumstances, surprisingly however, the group as a whole adapted and was flexible enough in our labour distribution that we were able to complete the same expected amount of work with everyone still pulling their own weight. Despite that, it has to be said that some group members exceeded what was needed of them, either due to passion for the project or simple determination to do a good job. As such, a few group members expressed regret for not being able to pull their weight as much as others did, however the expression of regret is the first sign of improvement. Everyone learnt and understood that their group members were willing to help each other to overcome difficulty, and as such everyone became comfortable with overcoming their own difficulty. Many times a group member would join a meeting even if they were on the train or bus, even if they couldn’t talk they would contribute via text messages. Despite that however, more people could have joined in on the practical work. </p>
									<p>Whilst almost everyone learned Blender despite having no prior experience, some people put more work into the creation of the project than others. Alisa, Beverly, Charles and Vansh did the majority of the work for the actual creation of the project, everyone else contributed an organ from Blender and mostly worked on the documental aspects of the project. While we efficiently distributed jobs and completed tasks, it left some of us having not touched all aspects of the project, which was detrimental as a learning experience. Such a problem has no easy fix, we were arguably only able to finish the project as efficiently because everyone understood their roles, but that left some of us having contributed less overall. If we had more time to do the project again, we could have everyone train new skills to contribute with. </p>
									<p>Overall, the group did very well to complete everything, and our group chemistry informs us that we would be better in the future as well.</p>
