												<h3>Eric Lin (s3844221)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Greetings, my name is Eric, I am a 19 year old from a Chinese background but I was born here in Melbourne. As a 2nd Year Bachelor of Biotechnology student, I am studying to be a microbiologist and spend my leisure time either playing games, watching Youtube or as a hobbyist writer. I took up Introduction to Information Technology as an elective because I believe literacy in Information Technology to be a fundamental skill going forward into the future. In College, I took IT Software Development and learned basic C# programming, I have skill in Excel Spreadsheet due to my experience in Bioinformatics and publishing online novels. 											</p>
											<p><strong>career plans:</strong>While I have a great interest in IT, I still wish to pursue Biology as my current career, which seems to make me unique in this group. However, many biotech jobs will still require a good understanding of IT. Excel spreadsheet is an obvious one, not to mention this project has given me valuable team skills, which I can translate in the lab when working and preparing large projects. After this, I would like to become a student lab assistant, gaining valuable skills as well as connections. </p>

												<h3>Beverly Li Fa Mu (s3784880)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My name is Beverly, I’m 20 years old, Chinese-Timorese, and I moved to Melbourne 10 years ago. Even as a final year Bachelor of Physics student, my underlying interest in electronic media incited me to choose Introduction to Information Technology as an elective. Past classes I’ve had involving IT include Introduction to Programming and Programming Fundamentals for Scientists where I learnt Java and Python, other IT related skills I am acquainted with is working with Unity and Blender. I have a vast list of hobbies, some include playing VR, doing makeup, gardening and chatting with friends.</p>
											<p><strong>career plans:</strong>With an underlying interest in web development and architecture, I would ideally work as a website designer in the future. This would include mapping and composing user-friendly interfaces that are visually aesthetic and efficient to an individual. Since I believe that I have a good eye for design, I have experience in website making and am extremely self-critical with a drive constantly to improve, I believe I can produce great results for the customer.											</p>

												<h3>Dante Filatow (s3901696)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Hi, my name is Dante. I’m Polish, raised in the UK and moved to Melbourne 12 years ago. I've graduated high school and started my first year bachelor degree in IT at RMIT this year. In my spare time, I follow F1,  playing video games, watching YouTube, karting and trading cryptocurrencies. My interest in IT came from being fascinated by crypto, video games, as well as programming and its implementation in future technologies. In high school, I undertook Software Development as an elective which resulted in experience with using Adobe Photoshop and Excel Spreadsheets, and also fundamental knowledge of CSS/HTML.</p>
											<p><strong>career plans:</strong>My ideal career plan is to initially work as a software developer for a leading tech company to gain higher-level skills and experience over a few years. Once I am satisfied with my time at the company, I plan to work on a contract basis on projects I actually enjoy and feel invested in preferably remotely. Ideally, I would be driven towards becoming a games developer, as my strong passion for games inspires me to, as a team program and develop a game for the public to enjoy.											</p>

												<h3>Alisa Kvashko (s3896312)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Hi, I’m Alisa. I was born in Russia and grew up in different parts of the world, but mainly here in Melbourne. I graduated from the class of 2020 in highschool and am currently completing a bachelor of IT at RMIT. I spend my time mostly watching Netflix, practising piano, drawing and eating. I first became interested in IT when I came across a command prompt in primary school and had fun pretending to code. I don’t have much experience in IT as I spent the most time on everchanging after school activities and stressing about class. However, I also became interested in robotics and AI when I attended an IT/Engineering seminar in which we assembled and coded our own robot.</p>
											<p><strong>career plans:</strong>My career plan is to work towards leading and developing software for other companies but preferably my own as working under another company for a few years has led me to want to create my own path/boundaries. After working on this project another option that’s ideal to me is working as a game developer as I get to involve more creativity into my work by designing, modeling and programming my own creations with the help of a small team or even myself.</p>

												<h3>Kaylyn Tran (s3900610)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I’m Kaylyn, 18 years old and a 1st year Bachelor of IT student. I have a Chinese and Vietnamese background but I was born and raised in Melbourne. I spend my spare time playing video games, listening to music, watching anime, reading manga and manhwa, and spending time with my mates. I also play games competitively. Initially, I had no interest in IT but after doing research on IT courses, I realised the innovation and design part of IT interested me a lot. In high school I finished one semester’s worth of the class ‘Information Technology’ which was mainly focused on website design and excel spreadsheets. Aside from this, I don’t have much experience in IT. </p>
											<p><strong>career plans:</strong>While I still have an interest in web development, as of now I would like to become a UX designer that will work on the design and usability of both computer and phone apps and websites. In the beginning I’d like to gain experience working as a UX designer in teams as well as build valuable connections, but eventually would like to become a freelance UX designer due to increased flexibility and career independence.</p>

												<h3>Yifan (Charles) Wang (s3894453)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My name is Yifan Wang, you can also call me Charles. My student number is s3894453. And my email address is s3894453@student.rmit.edu.au. I am an international student, and I am from China. I arrived in Australia in 2016 and started learning at Melbourne language centre at Boxhill. After half a year's learning, I got a level four certificate (which is the highest level) and graduated from the Language Centre! I started learning at Viewbank College in year 9. Because they do not have many international students, My English is improving fast at that time, but still struggling to understand in class. At the end of year 9, I did well in the AEAS test, and transferred to Mentone Grammar at the start of year 10. And I kept learning at Mentone Grammar until I graduated. Before I came to Australia, I played Taekwondo for 6 years, and won championships in different levels of games. But after living for 4 years, my weight went from 120 kg to 180 kg. I like to play video games. For online games, I play League of Legends, CS:GO, Valorant, FIFA and 2k.</p>
											<p><strong>career plans:</strong>I have a strong interest in system architects. Ideally, I will first become a software developer in a large company, so that I can gain a lot of experience and a higher level of skills, and then I will try to work in the company As a system architect, after gaining many years of experience, I will try to start my own company and make my own applications.</p>

											<p>My name is Vansh Shah and my student number is S3896180. I am of Indian background but have been living in Melbourne for the past 13 or so years and graduated from Cheltenham Secondary College in 2020. Some of my hobbies include soccer, anime and gaming as well as having an in-depth knowledge of laptops and mobile as well as photography. I have a bit of IT experience building the framework of a website back in year 12.</p>
											<p><strong>career plans:</strong>My goal is to create a business that creates/ modifies software for businesses or our own apps. To reach that point I want to work for many different companies whether it be as a web developer or a software developer or others such as HR.</br>
												This way I can also create new connections in the IT world and also get savings to open the business because this sort of business requires more than 1 person as 1 person skills. The connections could lead to possible employees, partners or clients.</p>

										<h2>Group Processes</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As a group in assignment 2 we worked very well. We thoroughly communicated through discord, teams, classes and weekly meetings (recorded) to discuss and understand what needs to be done as well as help eachother out if we are unsure. We were mostly passionate with what we were working on so it was great to share our input and listen to everyone. However we did have trouble getting our parts done on time and some members weren’t able to progress with their parts until the others were done. 
										In this assignment (3), we will still have the same modes of communication through different platforms and meetings. However for the team we will be introducing smaller and doable deadlines for paragraphs, concepts and model building. This will allow us to work on our time management and give suitable time for everyone to finish their parts that are needed for others. </p>
									<p>For the more technical processes we will be working in a similar document layout for this assignment and completing each text part. Correspondingly the website will be updated with a new template but have the same process of adding in the text as we progress with writing (However mostly having commits towards the end). As this is a more developmental assignment the new introduced processes will include a designing, a modelling, a developing and a testing procedure, unlike in the previous project. </p>
									<p>In the designing process we will formulate a rough concept of a classroom and develop it into a more refined direction. After the design we can model or gather objects for the classroom. In the developing process the design and gathered/modeled objects will be incorporated into a built VR class world. The testing procedure will be an active process of testing each stage of the project to debug, make sure controls work and the VR world is running correctly. </p>

										<h2>Group comparison</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Some of the common trends within everyone's career plans is obviously the use of IT within everyone's desired industries. Everyone needs practical skills such as understanding a variety of programming languages whilst only half need more designing-oriented skills. Most of the team also share an interest in doing independent work through freelancing and setting up their own companies. To go down this path, most of the team wants to work with other teams/companies to grow networking connections and assets before pursuing a more independent route.</p>
									<p>Differentiations within everyone's roles mainly includes the even distribution of our group wanting to go into different careers such as web UI/UX design (Beverly & Kaylyn), software developers (Dante, Charles, Vansh & Alisa), game developers (Dante & Alisa) and mostly juxtaposing, because of Eric’s biology major, a student lab assistant. A major difference is how everyone's career approach will be such as contract work (Dante), freelancing (Beverly, Kaylyn & Alisa), business owners (Vansh, Charles & Alisa) and mostly company experience with most members.</p>
									<p>Kaylyn’s and Beverly’s career plan is similar as they are wanting to pursue UX and UI, correspondingly in web development. Dante’s and Alisa’s direction are also alike as they want to pursue software development and then ideally go into game development. Vansh and Charles also want to pursue software development and other similar roles, however as they progress with more experience they plan to create their own company. Eric’s plan is more different to the groups as he wants to seek working as a lab assistant after gaining company experience from a biotech business rather than IT like everyone else. There are equally similarities in specific groups of peoples plans as well as an outlier smaller group with a different modal to others. Collectively everyone prefers to be building towards working independently or in a small team, however Vansh’s and Charles’ plan is to build a company involving more people. Over time everyone in the group needs similar skills to achieve their plans.</p>
